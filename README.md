# 🌱 SeedAware – Aadhaar-Seeded DBT Awareness Portal

## 📋 Overview
**SeedAware** is a mobile-first web portal designed to create awareness and assist beneficiaries in verifying their **Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts** for **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)** schemes. Many beneficiaries face issues such as failed transfers due to unlinked or mismatched Aadhaar numbers. SeedAware bridges this gap by providing a simple, interactive, and privacy-first solution for users and community workers. 💡
